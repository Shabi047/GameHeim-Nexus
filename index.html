                <h2>Metro Exodus</h2>
                <p>
                    Metro Exodus is a 2019 first-person shooter game developed by 4A Games and published by Deep Silver. The game is the third installment in the Metro video game series, which is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novels.

                </div>
                <ul>
                <li>Like earlier games in the series, Metro Exodus is a first-person shooter.</li>
                    <li>The player controls player-character Artyom, who must leave the tunnels of Moscow and travel across the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the former Russian Federation and Republic of Kazakhstan while fighting against mutated creatures and hostile humans</li>
                    <li>The game occurs in one in-game year; environments change along with the seasons as the story progresses</li>
                    <li>Like earlier Metro games, Metro Exodus includes linear missions and introduces several large, open spaces for players to explore </li>
                    <li>Using binoculars, players can identify points of interest in the game's map </li>
                    <li>Players can find collectible items such as diary entries and postcards </li>
                    <li>Some areas are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn due to toxic air</li>
                    <li>Each gas filter lasts one minute each, and these must be replaced provided the player has more in reserve</li>
                    <li>Players must wipe off dirt and blood splatter that collect on the gas mask, which may crack if it is damaged, and players must temporarily repair it using duct tape</li>
                    <li>The game features a minimalist head-up display (HUD); information is usually displayed to the player through tangible objects. For instance, a timer on Artyom's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires</li>
                    <li>A compass that displays the direction of their objectives can be attached to the wristwatch.</li>
